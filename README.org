** Introduction

To create my customized configuration I am using existing the items noted below.
This is just me taking other people's work and blending them together with small
tweaks to fit my needs and preferences.

To make understanding emacs easier, I use a blend of my own customized version
and also using distributions. The problem with only using distributions is if
something goes wrong or if you want to customize something, it is much harder to
get to the bottom of what is going on. Doom Emacs and spacemacs are both really
excellent and they are a great tools for many people. I still highly recommend
them if you want a distribution. I use them both, but I find spacemacs
keybindings to be especially well structured. They help you discover new
features and streamline various workflows.

  - This configuration is my new base for my personal configuration. This is
    nice because it helps you learn emacs lisp and some of the emacs concepts,
    but also gives you structured starting point and lots of options that you
    can use or you can ignore.

  the Emacs starter configuration is very helpful. I only stopped because I like
  being able to also use neovim or plain vim in addition to Emacs.)

** Random Notes
- F12 key to turn on evil mode (default is evil mode is on) - once you press
  this once it will say E-ON so you know it is enabled
- F11 key to turn off evil mode - once you press this once it will say E-OFF so
  you know it is disabled
- If stuck in a menu in Emacs try the following - Ctrl + g and / or ESC ESC ESC
  (three times in a row) - if that does not work you could be in a recursive
  edit so then do CTRL + ] first and then try one or both of the C-g / ESC x 3
- in dired use capital E to launch in windows explorer / linux explorer named
  caja in the window manager for the MATE desktop environment

- ;; In an emacs lisp scratch buffer you can run this code to double
- ;; check value of variable:
- ;; (message "Current fill-column value: %d" fill-column)
- ;; M-x display-fill-column-indicator-mode
- ;; to show vertical line at the fill-column
- ;; highlight text and press ALT-q to fill text to that width (emacs mode)
- ;; in evil mode press gw or gq to do the same
