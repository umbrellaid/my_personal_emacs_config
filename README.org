** Introduction

To create this customized configuration I am using existing the items noted
below. This is just me taking other people's work and blending them together
with small tweaks to fit my needs and preferences.

To make understanding emacs easier, I am not using distributions
anymore, but I will leave my minor notes on doom on my other GitHub
page. The problem like many others have written about is if something
goes wrong or if you want to customize something, the more complex the
configuration you are working on the harder it is to get to the bottom
of what is going on. Doom emacs is my favorite distribution with
spacemacs coming in as a close second. They both are really excellent
and they are a great tool for many people. I still recommend them if
you want a distribution.
