** Introduction

To create this customized configuration I am using existing the items noted
below. This is just me taking other people's work and blending them together
with small tweaks to fit my needs and preferences.

To make understanding emacs easier, I am not using distributions
anymore. The problem like many others have written about is if something
goes wrong or if you want to customize something, the more complex the
configuration you are working on the harder it is to get to the bottom
of what is going on. Doom Emacs and spacemacs are both really excellent
and they are a great tools for many people. I still recommend them if
you want a distribution.

  the Emacs starter configuration is very helpful. I only stopped because I like
  being able to also use neovim or plain vim in addition to Emacs.)

** Random Notes
- Insert Key to turn on evil mode (default is evil mode is off, plain vanilla
  Emacs keybindings are the starting point) - once you press this once it will say E-ON so you know it is enabled
- Pause Key to turn off evil mode - once you press this once it will say E-OFF so you know it is disabled
- If stuck in a menu in Emacs try the following - Ctrl + g and / or ESC ESC ESC (three
  times in a row) - if that does not work you could be in a recursive edit so
  then do CTRL + ] first and then try one or both of the C-g / ESC x 3
- C-x M-$ - turn on flyspell for buffer or selection
- in dired use capital E to launch in explorer / dolphin
- press pause key to re-indent file using emacs smarts
- ;; In an emacs lisp scratch buffer you can run this code to double
- ;; check value of variable:
- ;; (message "Current fill-column value: %d" fill-column)
- ;; M-x display-fill-column-indicator-mode
- ;; to show vertical line at the fill-column
- ;; highlight text and press ALT-q to fill text to that width
